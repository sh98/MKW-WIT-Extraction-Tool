# MKW WIT Extraction Tool
This tool can extract files from an MKW iso.

# It won't work. WHY?
Because you need WIT installed on your computer.
You can download WIT from: https://wit.wiimm.de/

# How do I use it?
Simply run the batchfile and find out! If you need any help, my Discord is Person#3717.
